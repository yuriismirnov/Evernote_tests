# Evernote_tests
Tests using Java, Selenide

There are tests for Evernote website. They're located in 2 java classes:
LoginTest.java
NotesTest.java

For running this build, you need:
- install IntellijIDEA;
- clone project;
- open some files with test;
- run via Shift+F10 command;

4. Login again and make sure you open the note create in step 3
This task cannot be done due to abnormal locators on site. These locators are not looking good and they can be changed, so the test will be failed after run setup.
